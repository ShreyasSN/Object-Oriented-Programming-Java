# Object Oriented Programming Java

This repository is a comprehensive guide to learning Java programming. It covers fundamental and advanced topics, including object-oriented programming (OOP), the collections framework, exception handling, and boundary handling.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Basic Java**
- Core concepts like variables, data types, operators, control structures, and functions.
- Input/output handling.
- Command-line arguments.

### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit using classes.
- **Inheritance**: Reusing and extending existing code by inheriting properties and behaviors.
- **Polymorphism**: Achieving flexibility through method overloading and overriding.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details using abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating and managing real-world representations in code.

### 3. **Collections Framework**
- Working with:
  - **List**: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`
  - **Set**: `HashSet`, `TreeSet`
  - **Map**: `HashMap`, `TreeMap`
  - **Queue**: `PriorityQueue`
- Sorting and searching data structures.
- Iterators and streams for efficient manipulation.

### 4. **Exception Handling**
- Handling runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws`.
- Custom exception classes for domain-specific errors.

### 5. **Boundary Handling**
- Managing edge cases to ensure code works under extreme input conditions.
- Validating input and handling overflows/underflows.


## Prerequisites

- Install the Java Development Kit (JDK).
- Basic understanding of programming concepts.
- Familiarity with IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional but helpful).
